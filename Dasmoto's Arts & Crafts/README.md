Dasmoto's Art Supplies
# HTML
# CSS
-------
This HTMl based website is a simple display of Dasmoto's Art Supplies, along with pictures, descriptions, and prices of all the items. 
-------
CSS was heavily utilized to keep the project simple and allow for reoccuring features (paragraph styling, heading styling) to be placed into one class.
-------
Since the client demanded the use of different color banners per item, I had to use ID's to give each banner unique CSS code. 
-------
**The biggest issue was having to make 3 separate banner ID's. 
In the future, I hope to simplify this process by turning the ID into a class and figuring out a way to 
change just the color.
To bring down word count in the CSS, I could have listed all the properties under a list of h1, h2, h3, and p - since they all contain the same properties.
